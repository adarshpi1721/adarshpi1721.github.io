                <h3>Biomimicry of Fish Locomotion</h3>
                <p>
                    Ongoing undergraduate research where I work on understanding and improving
                    the propulsive performance of flapping foils using morphing. I developed 
                    ALE-based 2D models to study morphing–pitching–heaving motion and showed 
                    that morphing can increase thrust by up to 31% and efficiency by 12%. 
                    I also extended this work to a tandem-foil setup to replicate fish schools 
                    and analyzed the wake using DMD.

                <h3>Ornithopter</h3>
                <p>
                    I led the design of a dual-crank flapping mechanism to replicate controlled bird-like motion.
                    Later, I integrated trailing-edge morphing to improve thrust and stability, and we achieved
                    a stable 7-second flight. This project is where my interest in biomimicry and unsteady aerodynamics really began.

                <h3>Trailing-Edge Morphing for Enhanced Propulsive Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    This work focuses on understanding how chordwise trailing-edge morphing affects thrust,
                    lift, and power. The study was presented at FMFP ’24 and later submitted to 
                    Physics of Fluids. The main idea is that active flexibility can help flapping foils 
                    adapt to their flow environment and consistently generate higher thrust.

                <h3>Suppression of Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV)</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of this project, I helped set up a low-speed wind tunnel facility and performed 
                    validation tests on airfoils and cylinders (up to 96% accuracy). I also developed an 
                    OpenFOAM solver to simulate the VIV response of a 2D cylinder and studied passive 
                    techniques to suppress the vibrations.

                <h3>Ytterbium Beam Collimation — Rarefied Gas Dynamics</h3>
                <p>
                    For my thesis at IIT Bombay, I analyze how Knudsen-number-dependent effects influence 
                    beam directionality and flux distribution. The goal is to improve the collimation of 
                    ytterbium beams, which has applications in precision biomedical imaging and diagnostics.

                <h3>Drone Rotor Flow & Graphene Heat Conduction (DHIO Internship)</h3>
                <p>
                    During this internship, I applied my CFD background to industry-scale problems using 
                    ParticleWorks and ASAP. I worked on simulating flow around drone-rotor tips and studied 
                    conduction in graphene nanoribbons, adapting my academic CFD experience to real-world setups.
