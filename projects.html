                        <h3>Morphing Foils — Biomimicry of Fish Locomotion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ongoing research combining chordwise trailing-edge morphing with pitching–heaving 
                            motion to replicate fish-like locomotion and improve propulsion. Using ALE-based 
                            2D models and DMD wake analysis, I studied how morph timing affects thrust, 
                            efficiency, and wake structure. This work led to thrust increases of ~35% and 
                            efficiency gains of ~12%, and was presented at FMFP ’24 and submitted to 
                            Physics of Fluids.

                        <h3>Ornithopter</h3>
                        <p>
                            Designed and built a dual-crank active flapping ornithopter inspired by 
                            bird flight. After achieving controlled, repeatable kinematics, I added 
                            trailing-edge morphing to boost thrust and stability. Result: a stable 
                            7-second flight and lots of lessons about FSI in the real world.

                        <h3>Suppression of Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV)</h3>
                        <p>
                            I worked on passive VIV suppression techniques while helping build and validate 
                            a low-speed wind tunnel (up to ~96% accuracy). I developed an OpenFOAM 
                            solver for 2D VIV, explored passive devices like splitter plates and control cylinders, 
                            and compared simulation trends with experimental data.
