                        <p>
                            Designed and built an ornithopter (an aircraft that replicated bird motion) using
                            a dual crank mechanism for flapping. Once we had a stable and repeatable motion, 
                            I added a simple trailing-edge morphing element to improve thrust and life. With 
                            this, we achieved a controlled 7-second flight!

                            Ongoing research work aimed at replicating the motion used by fish. I analyzed different 
                            configurations and found out that morphing (adding flexibility to foils) can help increase 
                            thrust by around 35% and efficiency by around 12%. This was later extended by analyzing these 
                            morphing foils in fish schools (using a simplified tandem model), which helped improve the 
                            propulsive coefficients even further.

                        <p>
                            Worked on passive VIV control for circular cylinders. I helped set up and validate a low-speed
                            wind tunnel (up to ~96% accuracy for validation tests) and developed a 2D VIV solver in
                            OpenFOAM. The goal was to come up with unique passive additions to a cylinder to analyze how
                            it affects the vibrations on the cylinder, ultimately trying to suppress these vibrations.
