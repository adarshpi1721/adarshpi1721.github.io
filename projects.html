                            Designed and built a bird-inspired ornithopter with a mechanically driven flapping mechanism.
                            Once we had a stable and repeatable flight, I added a simple trailing-edge morphing element
                            to improve thrust and stability. We achieved a controlled 7-second flight and learned how
                            sensitive real hardware is to timing, stiffness, and mass distribution.

                            Ongoing work on fish-like propulsion using trailing-edge morphing on a pitching–heaving foil.
                            I built ALE-based 2D simulations and used DMD on the wake to understand how morph timing and
                            amplitude affect thrust, efficiency, and vortex structure. In the best cases, we see roughly
                            31% higher thrust and a cleaner reverse von Kármán wake.

                        <p>
                            Worked on passive VIV control for circular cylinders. I helped build and validate a low-speed
                            wind tunnel (up to ~96% agreement with reference data) and developed a 2D VIV solver in
                            OpenFOAM. The project compared different passive devices and studied how they modify lift,
                            drag, and vibration response by changing the wake.
