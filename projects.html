                        <p>
                            Designed and built an ornithopter (an aircraft that replicated bird motion) using
                            a dual crank mechanism for flapping. Once we had a stable and repeatable flight, 
                            I added a simple trailing-edge morphing element to improve thrust. We achieved a 
                            controlled 7-second flight!

                            Ongoing research work aimed at replicating the motion used by fish. I analyzed different 
                            configurations and found out that morphing can help increase thrust by around 35% and efficiency 
                            by around 12%. This was later extended by analyzing these morphing foils in a tandem
                            configuration, which helped improve the propulsive coefficients even further.

                        <p>
                            Worked on passive VIV control for circular cylinders. I helped setup and validate a low-speed
                            wind tunnel (up to ~96% agreement with reference data) and developed a 2D VIV solver in
                            OpenFOAM. The project compared different passive devices and studied how they modify lift,
                            drag, and vibration response by changing the wake.
