        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>

          The goal of this project was to analyse the effects of trailing-edge morphing foils by
          adding it to flapping foils. In layman's terms, adding flexibility to an airfoil that 
          rotates about its leading edge (front) and moves vertically. By analysing different 
          configurations of morphing, I found out that this layer of flexibility can improve 
          thrust by around 35% and efficiency by 12%. To increase this even further, I realized
          that analyzing these foils in fish schools might be very beneficial. So, a simplified
          tandem model was analysed, and it turns out we could increase the efficiency by 525! compared 
          to our original flapping foil (although it isn't an apples-to-apples comparison)
        </p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          I knew that there were very few successful replications of fish locomotion. Even the best ones,
          didn't nearly come close to actually replicating fish motion. My goal was basically to start off
          with a simpler problem (which is how all great problems are solved), and try to get to the ideal 
          undulatory motion (the one used by fish). This is also why the current project is ongoing. With 
          morphing, we figured out that the thrust and efficiency can come close to that of undulatory foils
          but it still isn't good enough (ended where I started from)
        </p>
        

        <h3>Key findings</h3>
        <p>
          Flexibility actually improves thrust and efficiency! In fact, by a decent enough margin that it can
          be a viable solution for UAVs in the future (although it is not quite there yet). I found that when 
          morphing can increase thrust by around 35% and efficiency by 12%. Additionally, when it interacts with
          other vortices, the morphing foil can increase its own thrust and efficiency by a substantial margin. 
          Interestingly, the trends for thrust, power, and efficiency end up remaining similar.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          The scientific method! It was a great learning experience for me and served as a pivotal moment in my 
          career as a researcher. After being stuck for days trying to figure out how morphing affects the flow 
          physics, I finally realized that it affects the flow around it in a similar manner, irrespective of the 
          flow conditions. I am not sure if I can give out more info than this since the journal manuscript is only 
          been submitted.
