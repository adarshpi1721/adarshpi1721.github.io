        <h2>Morphing Foils — Biomimicry of Fish Locomotion</h2>

        <div class="project-image-placeholder">Image Placeholder</div>

        <p><strong>Summary —</strong> This project merges two interconnected threads: using chordwise trailing-edge morphing to actively tune a flapping foil’s camber, and understanding how fish-like tandem arrangements exploit wakes. The work uses ALE-based 2D simulations, DMD wake analysis, and targeted bench checks. Results show morphing can raise thrust by ~31% and improve propulsive efficiency by ~12% in tested cases.</p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>I used a deliberately simple ALE 2D modeling framework to keep physics interpretable. Key steps were:
        <ul>
          <li>Define a baseline pitching–heaving kinematic; add morphing as an extra DOF (amplitude + phase).</li>
          <li>Perform parameter sweeps (morph amplitude, phase offset, reduced frequency) and compute time-averaged thrust, lift, and power coefficients.</li>
          <li>Run tandem-foil cases to examine downstream responses and use DMD on snapshots to extract coherent wake structures.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Key findings</h3>
        <p>
          - Morph timing matters: morphing that reinforces thrust-producing vortices on the downstroke yields net gains.<br>
          - Gains were robust across moderate Reynolds number ranges sampled; tandem configurations showed potential for further boost by placing a morphing foil downstream of a flapping leader.<br>
          - DMD showed that morphing shifts dominant wake modes and phase relationships, explaining the robustness of thrust trends.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Practical challenges</h3>
        <p>Numerically, mesh deformation and timestep selection required careful tuning to avoid instabilities from the moving trailing edge. Experimentally, actuation and power trade-offs (more actuators = more weight & power draw) must be balanced against aerodynamic gains.</p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>This project taught me to marry interpretable simulation design with physical intuition. Often small timing changes flip outcomes — focusing on mechanism (wake timing, vortex formation) made the difference between a convincing result and an ambiguous one.</p>
