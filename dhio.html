        <h2>Conduction of Graphene and Flow Around Drone Rotors</h2>

        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          My first research internship, where I got hands-on experience with industry-level software. 
          Primarily, my work focused on simulating various properties of graphene nanoribbons, like phonon
          dispersion plots and optimized geometry configurations. I used the software ASAP to simulate these
          nanoribbons, and for simulating the flow around drone rotors, I used Particleworks, which is a 
          meshless software.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learnt</h3>
        <p>
          Approaching the topic of quantum physics was quite new to me. Unlike fluid mechanics, my background 
          in mechanical engineering meant I didn't necessarily have all the resources to fully comprehend
          wave functions and DFT. This meant I spent the initial days of my time learning about the basics 
          of DFT, how it is actually implemented in the software, and what results we get out of it. I had 
          to perform hand calculations, as was advised by my mentor, which meant I had to understand some aspects
          of the software at a fundamental level.
        </p>

        <h3>Key observations</h3>
        <p>
          The rotor simulations suggested small geometry changes that reduce peak tip velocities
          and potentially lower noise. The conduction studies showed how ribbon width and edge
          characteristics influence effective thermal transport, which is important for thermal
          management design.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          The internship was a good reality check on how simulations are used in practice:
          reliability, turnaround time, and clear communication are as important as accuracy.
          I also got comfortable adapting from academic solvers to industry tools and workflows.
