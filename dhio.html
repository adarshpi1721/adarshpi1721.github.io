        <h2>Drone Rotor Flow & Graphene Heat Conduction (DHIO Internship)</h2>

        <div class="project-image-placeholder">Image Placeholder</div>

        <p><strong>Summary —</strong> During my internship I applied academic CFD experience to industry problems using ParticleWorks for rotor-tip flows and ASAP for quantum / conduction simulations. The work was about adapting research workflows to industry-grade tools and constraints, delivering practical simulation results for engineering decisions.</p>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>I focused on two threads: (1) simulating flow near rotor tips to study tip losses and acoustic signatures, and (2) running conduction/transport studies on graphene nanoribbons for thermal management insight. My role was to set up accurate boundary conditions, run parametric cases, and produce concise deliverables that engineers could act on.</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>The rotor simulations highlighted design changes that reduced peak tip velocities and suggested small geometry tweaks that reduce noise. The graphene conduction studies clarified how ribbon width and edge defects affect conduction at useful operating ranges. The internship sharpened my ability to translate simulation results into concrete design recommendations.</p>

        <h3>Challenges & lessons</h3>
        <p>Industry workflows require faster turnarounds and more emphasis on robustness and reproducibility than academic proofs-of-concept. I learned to document simulation pipelines, use industry-standard tools effectively, and communicate results to non-specialists concisely.</p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>This internship was a reality check: practical engineering needs quick, reliable answers and clear trade-off communication. It improved my simulation speed, my reporting skills, and my appetite for applied research.</p>
