        <h2>Conduction of Graphene and Flow Around Drone Rotors</h2>

        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          My first research internship, where I got hands-on experience with industry-level software. 
          Primarily, my work focused on simulating various properties of graphene nanoribbons, like phonon
          dispersion plots and optimized geometry configurations. I used the software ASAP to simulate these
          nanoribbons, and for simulating the flow around drone rotors, I used Particleworks, which is a 
          meshless software.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learnt</h3>
        <p>
          Approaching the topic of quantum physics was quite new to me. Unlike fluid mechanics, my background 
          in mechanical engineering meant I didn't necessarily have all the resources to fully comprehend
          wave functions and DFT (density functional theory). This meant I spent the initial days of my time learning about the basics 
          of DFT, how it is actually implemented in the software, and what results we get out of it. I had 
          to perform hand calculations, as was advised by my mentor, which meant I had to understand some aspects
          of the software at a fundamental level. For simulation of drone rotors, I used Particleworks, which was
          relatively easier to grasp due to my growing interest in CFD at the time and background with simulating 
          morphing motion.
        </p>

        <h3>Key observations</h3>
        <p>
          The rotor simulations suggested small geometry changes that reduce peak tip velocities
          and potentially lower noise. As for the graphene nanoribbons, my goal was to analyze how changing the 
          edge particles would affect the geometry. Due to the internship being only 2 months long, I was
          not fully able to analyze the effects of different atoms. Although I was able to analyze the isolated
          properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbon and validate it with previous research conducted.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          Being my first internship experience, I got to learn what it means to be in a team environment at a 
          corporate level and how to coordinate with other members of the team. I also got some insight into 
          how the company chooses projects and takes on clients from the goverment. Mainly, it sparked a newfound
          love for quantum physics (something I had buried deep in high school) and showed me how it is more
          relevant than I could have ever imagined.
