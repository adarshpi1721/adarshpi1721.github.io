        <h2>Ytterbium Beam Collimation — Rarefied Gas Dynamics</h2>

        <p><strong>Summary —</strong>
          For my thesis at IIT Bombay I study how rarefied gas effects (through the Knudsen number)
          influence the collimation of ytterbium beams. The work connects gas-kinetic behavior with
          beam shaping needs in precision imaging and instrumentation.

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          I use models that account for molecular mean free path and run parametric simulations over
          background pressure, nozzle geometry, and source conditions. The idea is to see how these
          parameters affect directionality and flux distribution and to identify combinations that
          lead to well-collimated beams.
        </p>

        <h3>Key observations</h3>
        <p>
          Near transitional regimes, small geometric tweaks can noticeably change beam spread and
          uniformity. This suggests that careful nozzle design and operating conditions can provide
          significant gains before relying on downstream optical corrections.
        </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          The project pushed me to think beyond standard continuum CFD and work with rarefied models.
          It has also been a good exercise in balancing analytical approximations, computational cost,
          and the practical requirements of an experimental setup.
