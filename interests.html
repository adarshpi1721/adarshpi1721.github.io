                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>My interests primarily lie in ethics and religion. I love delving into the works of various philosophers, their ideologies, and teachings. I consider philosophy to be one of the most important forms of knowledge (since one of its primary goals is to literally teach us how to live).</p>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Tennis</h3>
                <p>I've been playing tennis ever since I was a kid, and I love watching/playing it even today. I even wrote that I wanted to grow up to win a Grand Slam in my childhood report card. While my current favorite is Jannik Sinner, watching Federer play remains one of my favorite pastimes. </p>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>It is severely understated how much books can influence once lives. While I love reading Classic Literature, most books have a lot to offer since they give us insight into another person's psyche and what they were going through at a particular point in time. </p>
